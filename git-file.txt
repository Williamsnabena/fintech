The Progressive Conservatives haven’t released a platform,
but made significant funding announcements for health care,
schools and transit in the latter stages of their government.
The party’s 2022 budget wasn’t passed and the PCs pledge to
bring those funding promises back to the table if re-elected.




The NDP, which served as Official Opposition for the past four years,
released a full platform in April and unveiled costing details in mid-May,
while both the Liberals and the Greens have released fully costed platforms.
